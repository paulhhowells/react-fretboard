# TO DO

## Features
* [x] note types for styling, e.g. passing b5
* [x] option to show notes as intervals / scale degrees
* [ ] layers, e.g. scale layer over chord layer, or shadow chord layer over scale
* [x] settings view
* [x] add setting > select tuning
* [x] pale notes at nut
* [x] fretboard spacing, even || rule of eighteen
* [x] use local storage
* [ ] summary text
* [ ] make design responsive, e.g. fretboard width
* [ ] string muting
* [ ] connector layer, interval lines, e.g. for parallel 6ths
* Blues mode: find a good way to show IIm chords
* Blues mode: find a good way to show the other pentatonics that work over each degree, and avoid those that donâ€™t
* string nut position for banjo - specify fret in tuning
* add Dorian mode
* piano roll - set changes through time
	* bpm / speed / bars
	* number of bars 4, 8, 12, 16, custom
	* 808 drum machine UI ?
	* for each bar set mode & scale type
		* thus chord changes and scale changes possible
* sound: play root notes? midi?
* sync changes to an audio file?
* [x] roll fretboard edges (reduce edge to string distance)
* Jazz ?

## Fix
* [ ] D Major Blues I has Gb - is it because of passing note?
* [x] mixolydian flat notes - improve use of flats & sharps
* [x] diatonic degrees
* [x] fix font size in note
* [x] font for sharp & flat spacing

## Refactor
* context
* CSS
* constants
* ensure state does not trigger multiple renders
* think about enums
* combine context with state hooks
* select menu for key
